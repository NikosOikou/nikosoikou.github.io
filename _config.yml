            - Collaborated with a growth strategy manager to run analyses on pricing, retention and churn for the Recolor Mobile App.
            The data were extracted from platforms such as iTunes Connect, Google Play Console and Tenjin and analyzed using <mark>BigQuery/SQL</mark>, <mark>pandas</mark>,
            <mark>Jupyter/Python</mark> and <mark>Mode Analytics/SQL</mark>.

            - Ran analyses related to the game economy and banner performance of the My Hospital Mobile App. The data were stored in <mark>Vertica</mark> through the DeltaDNA platform.

            - In collaboration with a front-end developer, I created a custom <mark>PHP</mark> dashboard that serves all Kuuhubb reporting. The data were stored in <mark>Postgres</mark>.
            I created a RESTful API that pre-aggregated finance and app user statistics. For the backend, I used <mark>Tornado/Python</mark>, for the data storage <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>Postman</mark> for testing,
            and deployed the app on <mark>Heroku</mark>.

            - Worked on the backend maintenance of the Recolor App, which uses <mark>Tornado/Python</mark>, <mark>Amazon RDS</mark> and <mark>Firebase</mark>,
            and on the backend maintenance of the Perfect Earth Mobile App, which is written in <mark>Django/Python</mark> and uses <mark>Amazon S3</mark> for data storage.

            - Worked as part of an agile team building and maintaining an in-house Real-Time Bidding platform handling 20,000 requests per second.
            The bidder was written in <mark>Django/Python</mark> and used <mark>redis</mark>, <mark>MongoDB</mark> and <mark>BigQuery/SQL</mark> for data storage,
            <mark>Kafka</mark> for real-time stream processing and <mark>Graphite</mark> for monitoring.

            - Lead and implemented the integration with AppNexus. I also implemented a system that would submit creatives to AppNexus for auditing before running on AppNexus real-time inventory.

            - Implemented various extensions to the internal campaign management platform using <mark>Django/Python</mark>. These extensions included a system to create and manage Facebook Audiences and extensions for geotargeting.
            The platform used <mark>Postgres</mark> for data storage, and for version control I used <mark>Mercurial</mark>.

            - Conducted analyses on <mark>BigQuery/SQL</mark> and <mark>Pandas/Python</mark> related to the longevity and suitability of Mobile advertising IDs for tracking and targeting.

            - Worked on a project aiming to facilitate and prioritize the physical inspection of 300,000 earthquake-hit buildings in the Groningen area.
            The project involved developing classification algorithms for building footprints and roof shapes, as well as proof-of-concepts for detecting high-risk elements on buildings, such as chimneys and parapets.

            - Based on <mark>pandas</mark>, <mark>scikit-learn</mark> and <mark>OpenCV</mark> books in the office library, I implemented proof-of-concept algorithms for traffic sign classification, postbox detection on doors,
            and 3D reconstruction of buildings from Google Street View images.
            I also wrote a 200-page report that was submitted to the Arup construction company.

            - Participated in hackathons and won 3rd at the Open Data Battle competition (Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure) for creating a route planner web app in <mark>Django/Python</mark> within the limited frame of 10 days.
